## Official plotting routines for my 2024 paper titled "[_Imaging reionization’s last phases with I-front Lyman-α emissions_](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14625v1)" 
Written and documented by Bayu Wilson. Most of the corresponding figures in `figures/` have the same name as the plotting routine.

| **Plotting Routine**    | **Description**                                                                                         |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `hist_vIF.py`     | Comparing I-front speed PDF's between full reion. and neutral island simulations   |
| `gas_slice_shaded.py`     |  A slice through a gas density field with a shaded neutral region |
| `zoom_slice.py`| A zoom-in on a neutral region of a slice. Other panels show I-front speed, LyC Flux, and Lya emitted from the I-front|
| `SB_9_panels.py`| 9 panels of Lya SB plots and then another column showing the SB CDF, average density, and average neutral fraction|
